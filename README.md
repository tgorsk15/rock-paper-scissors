# rock-paper-scissors
My first JS project 

AFTER COMPLETING
What I learned:

- How to randomly select items from an array
- How to combine both loops and conditional statements into one function
- How to build more complex logic into a larger sized conditional statement.
- You can call upon functions from within other functions
- something like computerSelection = getComputerScore() will actually CALL the function because of the parentheses
